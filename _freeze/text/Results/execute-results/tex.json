Of the events at\nTRE, 54 events were correctly identified as vessels, and 162 were correctly identified as ambient\nnoise. An additional 9 ambient events were incorrectly identified as vessels, and 262 true ship\nevents were incorrectly classified as ambient noise (Table 2). After manual review of the LTSA,\n344 vessels missed by the detector were added to the analysis for TRE. Including these added\nvessels as false negatives, this detector has a recall value of 0.08 and a precision value of 0.86\n(Table 2).\n\nAt TRW, the detector correctly classified 60 events as vessels and 195 events as ambient noise.\nThere were 4 false positive events where the detector incorrectly classified ambient noise as ship\nevents and 287 false negative events where ships were incorrectly classified as ambient noise.\nManual review of the LTSA was completed for the first 19 days of the deployment, in which 29\nadditional vessel passages were observed. The precision of the TRW detector (0.93) was similar\nto TRE (0.86).\n\nThe total number of detected ship events at both sites includes vessel events under 500 Hz,\nwhich are not used in further analysis throughout this report.\n\n\n![Detection matrix for automated ship detector used in Two Rocks East site.

For TRW, manual review of detections resulted in a total of 377 vessel signatures. At\nboth sites, vessel activity occurred throughout the deployment, although vessels were not present\nevery day. At TRE, vessels occurred on 56/57 days (98.2% of days, mean of 11.7 vessels/day\npresent), and in TRW vessels occurred on 54/57 days (94.7% of days, mean of 7 vessels/day\npresent).\n\nBoth sites showed similarities in duration of individual vessel signatures, with median values\nwithin 5 minutes (TRE = 24.2 minutes; TRW = 30.3 minutes); however, TRW showed a much\ngreater range of durations, with the longest continuous vessel signature lasting over 7 hours\n(Table 3, Fig. 2).\n\nAlthough vessels were present throughout the deployment, presence generally increased\nthroughout the month of December until a sharp decline on December 25 (Christmas holiday). A\nsimilar increasing trend occurred between December 25 and December 31 prior to a drop in\npresence on January 1 (New Year’s Day).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Vessel variance.\n\n|Site | N Vessels|Duration Range (minutes) | Duration Median (Minutes)|\n|:----|---------:|:------------------------|-------------------------:|\n|East |       660|1.01-260.0               |                      24.2|\n|West |       277|0.62-430.1               |                      30.3|\n|NA   |        NA|NA                       |                        NA|\n|NA   |        NA|NA                       |                        NA|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![**Figure 2:** Daily vessel duration (hour) separated by site.

TRE = Two Rocks East; TRW = Two Rocks West.](/images/Figure.2.PNG)\n\n\n## Weekday Vessel Presence\n\nAt both TRE and TRW, there was a pattern of higher vessel activity in the latter half of the week,\nwith the highest number of vessels occurring on Thursdays (TRE: N = 117; TRW: N = 89). Over\nhalf of all vessels occurred between Thursdays and Saturdays (TRE: N = 530, 80.3%; TRW: N =\n237, 62.9%) (Fig. 3).\n\nBoth sites showed the lowest overall activity on Mondays (TRE: N = 71, 10.7%; TRW: N = 39,\n10.3%) and Sundays (TRE: N = 80, 12.1%; TRW: N = 40, 10.6%).\n\n![**Figure 3:** Vessel activity by day of week at each site. TRE = Two Rocks East, TRW = Two Rocks West.](/images/Figure.3.PNG)\n\n## Diel Vessel Presence\n\nBased on sunrise (05:05 – 05:28) and sunset (19:01 – 19:26) times throughout the deployment,\nmost vessels at both sites occurred during daylight hours (05:00 – 18:00; TRE: N = 607, 92.0%,\nmedian = 52.5 vessels/hour; TRW: N = 329, 80.6%, median = 28.5 vessels/hour). The highest\nnumber of vessels in a single hour occurred at 07:00 at TRE (N = 80) and at 08:00 at TRW (N =\n43) (Fig. 4).\n\nOutside of these hours, the highest presence was in the 04:00 hour just before sunrise (TRE: N =\n26; TRW: N = 15). The remaining hours (20:00 – 03:00) were consistently lower in vessel counts\n(TRE: median = 2 vessels/hour, range = 0 – 7; TRW: median = 3 vessels/hour, range = 1 - 7).\n\n![**Figure 4:** Counts of vessel signatures per hour at each site. Hourly presence counts reflect the start time of each vessel signature. Times are reported in local time (AWST, UTC +8).](/images/Figure.4.PNG)\n\n## Propagation modeling and detection range\n\nThe following transmission loss (TL) equation was fit using empirical RL data from the\ncalibration tracks made at TRE (Eq. 1, Fig. 5). The TRW calibration tracks did not result in a\nplausible model of transmission loss, but due to similarity of habitat between the two sites, the\nTL model from TRE was used to determine vessels likely to occur within the NPZ boundaries\nfor both sites.\n\n(Eq. 1): \n$$\nTL_{TRE} = 19.94((r)) + 0.0000r\n$$\n\n![**Figure 5:** Regression line of received levels measured from acoustic recordings versus deployment vessel ranges taken from GPS points taken from Two Rocks East (TRE) sites. Color scale indicates peak frequency value of sound for each sound clip.](/images/Figure.5.PNG)\n\nModeled transmission loss and ambient noise levels were similar between TRE and TRW, with $NL_{50}$ values of 82.7 dB re 1μPa at TRE and 81.1 dB re 1μPa at TRW. The maximum detection distance for a representative medium-sized vessel at each site was also similar between the sites: TRE = 13.4 km, TRW = 16.1 km. The weighted mean distance between the recorder and the park boundary was 1851 meters for TRE and 1779 meters for TRW.\n\n## Total Vessel Presence within Park Boundaries\n\nFor TRE, 548 of the original 660 vessels were usable for propagation analysis. Of those, 181 (33.0% of usable vessels) were likely to occur within the NPZ boundary assuming they were small vessels (SL: 125 – 150 dB re 1μPa). Of those, 172 vessel signatures contained a maneuver (95.0%) (Table 4). Further, there were 33 vessels (6.0% of usable vessels) estimated to occur\nwithin the NPZ assuming they were either small or medium vessels (SL: 125 – 170 dB re 1μPa), with 31 signatures (93.9%) containing a maneuver (Table 4).\n\nAt TRW, 327 of the original 377 vessels were usable for propagation analysis. There were 105 vessels (32.1% of usable vessels) with $P_{small\\;in} > 0.75$. Of those, a majority of the signatures contained a maneuver (N = 100, 95.2%). If vessels were assumed to belong to either a small or medium size class, then 28 vessels (8.6% of usable vessels) were estimated to occur within the NPZ boundary. Of these, all signatures contained a maneuver. \n\nAt both sites, vessels were present inside the park boundary ($P_{in} > 0.75$) throughout the deployment, with the highest daily vessel presence by duration occurring in late December (TRE: December 23, 1.78 hours; TRW: December 29, 2.72 hours) (Fig. 6).\n\n\n\n![**Table 4:** Summary of vessel presence and vessels at each recording site estimated to occur within\nthe park boundaries surrounding Two Rocks East and Two Rocks West sites.](/images/Table.4.PNG)\n\n\n![**Figure 6:** Daily vessel duration (hour) of vessels estimated within park boundaries($P_{in} > 0.75$) T = transit, M = maneuver.](/images/Figure.6.PNG)\n\n## Weekday Vessel Presence within Park Boundaries\n\nAt TRE, Fridays had the highest vessel presence (N = 8), followed by Saturdays, Thursdays, and Tuesdays (N = 6 each day) (Fig. 7). The two transiting vessels without a maneuver occurred on Thursday and Friday (N = 1 vessel each day). At TRW, there was a more apparent effect of weekday, with 39.3% of all vessels with $P_{in} > 0.75$ occurring on Thursdays (N = 11).\n\n![**Figure 7:** Vessel activity by day of week and behavioral category of vessels estimated within park boundaries($P_{in} > 0.75$) T = transit, M = maneuver.](/images/Figure.7.PNG)\n\n## Diel Vessel Presence within Park Boundaries\n\nAt TRE, all vessels with $P_{in} > 0.75$ occurred between 00:00 - 15:00 AWST (range = 1 – 7 per hour) (Fig. 8). The highest number of vessels during a single hour occurred at 12:00 AWST (N = 7), with all of those vessels containing a maneuver. Transiting vessels without a maneuver were detected at 06:00 and 14:00 (N = 1 each hour).\n\nTRW showed a similar concentration of vessel activity early in the day, with the majority of vessels within the NPZ occurring between 05:00 and 15:00 AWST (N = 32, range = 1 – 6 per hour) (Fig. 8). The single vessel outside of daylight hours occurred at 22:00 AWST. Vessel activity peaked at 10:00 (N = 6), with a secondary peak at 08:00 (N = 4).\n\n![**Figure 8:** Counts of vessel signatures estimated within park boundaries($P_{in} > 0.75$) per hour separated by behavioral category.
