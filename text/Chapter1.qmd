Two Rocks Marine Park is part of the South-west Regional Management Network of the
Australian Marine Parks system. The selected National Park Zone (NPZ) (swtwonpz02)
represents a relatively shallow coastal habitat with a bottom type primarily consisting of
calcareous sand and gravel (Lucieer et al. 2017). Recorders were deployed at two sites within the
NPZ—Two Rocks East (TRE) and Two Rocks West (TRW)—to maximize coverage of the
monitoring area (Table 1, Fig. 1).
